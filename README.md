# 🌊 Gujarat Coastal Threat Alert System (GCTA-System)

**HackOut’25 Project – Team Gujju Tech**

## 📌 Problem Statement
Coastal areas face critical threats such as:
- Storm surges, cyclones, and coastal erosion  
- Algal blooms, pollution, and illegal dumping  
- Rising sea levels due to climate change  

Current early-warning systems are fragmented, slow, and often lack **location-specific alerts**.

---

## 🚀 Our Solution
We are building a **Comprehensive Early Warning & Alerting Platform** that:
- Collects real-time data from **sensors, satellites, and historical records**  
- Uses **multi-layer AI/ML models** to detect anomalies and predict early threats  
- Sends **smart, location-based notifications** to authorities and coastal communities  
- Provides a **dashboard** for role-based users (Govt, NGOs, fisherfolk, civil defence, etc.)

## 🏗️ System Architecture
1. **Data Collection Layer**  
   - Sensor feeds (tide gauges, weather stations)  
   - Satellite & historical data  
   - Data pipelines for structured input  

2. **AI/ML Layer**  
   - Multi-layer AI models with agentic capabilities  
   - Focused, **region-specific analysis**  
   - Predictions for storm surges, pollution, erosion  

3. **Notification Layer**  
   - Smart notification system (SMS, push, email)  
   - Role-based alerts (Govt, NGOs, Fisherfolk, etc.)  
   - Location-based targeting  

4. **User Platform**  
   - Web & mobile platform with **role-based login**  
   - Dashboard with **alerts, trends, and records**
